Question 1: What is the definition of server port?
---------------------------------------------------

A server port is like a door number on a computer that helps direct internet traffic to the right place.

Simple Explanation:
Imagine a big apartment building. The building has ONE street address (this is like an IP address).
But inside, there are many apartments (these are like ports). Each apartment has its own number.

When you want to visit someone, you need:
- The building address (IP address like 192.168.1.1)
- The apartment number (Port number like 80 or 443)

So a port is basically a numbered channel that lets different services run on the same computer at the same time.

Example:
- When you visit a website, your browser connects to Port 80 or 443
- When you send an email, it uses Port 25
- When you use SSH (like we did for the droplet), it uses Port 22


Question 2: What is server port range?
---------------------------------------

Port numbers go from 0 to 65,535 (that's 65,536 total ports!)

They are divided into 3 groups:

1. Well-Known Ports (0-1023)
   - These are the "VIP" ports reserved for important services
   - You need admin/root permission to use them
   - Examples: Port 80 (websites), Port 22 (SSH)

2. Registered Ports (1024-49151)
   - These are for regular applications and services
   - Anyone can use them
   - Examples: Port 3306 (MySQL database), Port 8080 (backup web server)

3. Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535)
   - These are temporary ports
   - Your computer uses them when connecting to websites
   - Like a "throwaway" phone number


Question 3: How many bits does the number above represent?
-----------------------------------------------------------

Answer: 16 bits

Why?
- Port numbers range from 0 to 65,535
- That's exactly 2^16 = 65,536 possible numbers
- So computers store port numbers using 16 bits

Quick Math:
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 65,536

Think of it like:
- 16 light switches that can be ON or OFF
- That gives you 65,536 different combinations!


Question 4: State 10 common server ports
-----------------------------------------

1. Port 22 - SSH (Secure Shell)
   What it does: Lets you securely connect to remote servers
   Real life use: When you typed "ssh root@178.128.236.255" - you used Port 22!
   Security: Encrypted (safe)

2. Port 80 - HTTP (Web Traffic)
   What it does: Regular website traffic
   Real life use: When you visit http://example.com
   Security: Not encrypted (anyone can see your data)

3. Port 443 - HTTPS (Secure Web Traffic)
   What it does: Secure website traffic
   Real life use: When you visit https://google.com or online banking
   Security: Encrypted (safe) - you'll see a padlock icon in browser

4. Port 21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
   What it does: Upload/download files to a server
   Real life use: Web developers uploading website files
   Security: Not encrypted (old technology)

5. Port 25 - SMTP (Email Sending)
   What it does: Sends emails between email servers
   Real life use: When you click "Send" in Gmail, it uses this port
   Security: Can be encrypted or not

6. Port 53 - DNS (Domain Name System)
   What it does: Converts website names to IP addresses
   Real life use: When you type "google.com", DNS finds its IP address
   Security: Usually not encrypted (but there's DNS over HTTPS now)

7. Port 3306 - MySQL Database
   What it does: Connects to MySQL databases
   Real life use: WordPress websites, web apps storing user data
   Security: Should be behind a firewall

8. Port 3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop)
   What it does: Control Windows computers remotely (like TeamViewer)
   Real life use: IT support accessing your computer to help you
   Security: Encrypted, but often targeted by hackers

9. Port 8080 - HTTP Alternative
   What it does: Backup port for web servers
   Real life use: When testing websites locally (localhost:8080)
   Security: Not encrypted (just like Port 80)

10. Port 110 - POP3 (Email Receiving)
    What it does: Download emails from mail server to your device
    Real life use: Outlook or Thunderbird downloading your emails
    Security: Not encrypted (unless using Port 995 for secure POP3)
